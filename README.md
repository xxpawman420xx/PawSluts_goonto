## I made this add-on script for https://github.com/dogkisser/goonto version of goonto - My script uses the windows exe file ran under wine with a custom .yml config file (you may edit the .yml to suit your taste but beware the windows exe file is very picky about spacing and line order, default is lots of paws and tickling, if you mess up then you can delete the .yml file and a new one will be made for you but it'll be the example file without my custom tweaks which makes my add-on script epic, or you can download my .yml file and place it in the same directory as the windows .exe file - the windows exe file also downloads all pics into a cache folder which is in the same directory as the windows exe, I havnt found a way to turn this setting off

**To use my add-on script first download the .zip file in this repo, extract it to a folder such as Documents, set PawSlut.sh to be executable and then right-click and choose run, the script will wait for a random time before starting (between 10 seconds and 2 minutes), then it will run for between 20 seconds and 1 minute before ending itself, it'll do this in a loop until you restart your system - if your feeling extra horny then feel free to add this script to your start-up programs list so the effect wont ever end until you remove it from start up programs and reboot - and if your feeling extra extra horny, then download the .zip file that says longer at the end, same instructions apply but it really is a super annoying version that can last for hours at a time only for extreme gooners :P**

**REQUIREMENTS:**
 1. you need wine installed, I made this add-on script using a pi5, so i installed the pi-apps version of wine (https://pi-apps.io/install-app/install-wine-x64-on-raspberry-pi/) but in theory other wine versions should work
 2. konsole (sudo apt install konsole if your missing it)
 3. Ubuntu 24.04
 4. A program to unzzip stuff
 5. this is for linux only and mostly just ubuntu - it may work with other distro's with some effort, it wont work with windows

if you need help setting up wine, consult google - if theres an issue with the windows binary contact the original author (https://github.com/dogkisser/goonto) or download a fresh one from their repo - if you have an issue with my script (PawSlut.sh) then feel free to contact me
